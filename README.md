# Sieve-of-Eratosthenes-Alg
C++ Implementation of Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm

Algorithm: Resolve the Sieve of Eratosthenes

Given a number N, find all of the prime numbers up to the number (in this case N)

PRIME-NUMBER - one which is evenly divisible only by 1 and by itself to equal 1

Optimization to the algorithm is look only for the numbers up to m such that m * m <= sqrt(n)

The algorithm does not compute the square root of N but tests the numbers upto N. 

The program asks for N at the beginning to be inputted from standard in.
